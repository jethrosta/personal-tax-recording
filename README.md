# üßæ Automated Tax Receipt Recording System using OCR and Google Integration

This project was designed to streamline my father's tax deduction process by automating the collection and organization of receipt data throughout the year. The core challenge was the absence of a system that could digitize and extract relevant information from receipts in a fast and structured way.

To solve this, I developed a receipt recording system powered by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and integrated with Mistral AI's advanced OCR API. The system captures receipt images, extracts key data fields (such as merchant, date, total amount, and tax category), and logs them automatically into a Google Spreadsheet. Additionally, the original receipt images are uploaded to Google Drive, with direct links included in the spreadsheet for verification and archival purposes.
